Final Project for COSI 2A

Not too long ago, intense political debates on healthcare stirred fear and uncertainty in the hearts of the three young Monty coders. Instead of clicking coconut shells together and running away from all their problems, these three young ladies decided to take their health into their own hands. The result of their work is the health application you see before you, which can provide information and tips on taking care of oneself, calculate one's essential health statistics, and help sort out the logistics of taking care of oneself or a loved one.

And now, a message from the creators of this application:
To ensure that you have a positive experience with this application, we'd like to provide some background on how best to use it. The primary file in this entire package is called main.py. This file opens the home page of the application which includes more specific instructions and allows you to access all the other functions within the package. Each function does something different; short descriptions are provided on the main.py homepage, and longer descriptions are printed when you choose to use/run those functions. (Note: You do not need to install additional libraries or modules to use this application.)

Each function takes user input and generates relevant output. They can also be run multiple times, and, once you have used the function to your heart's content, you are given the option to return to the homepage, as long as you follow the instructions correctly.

Given more time, we would most definitely have worked on building charts and graphs for users and making personalized accounts through which patients could directly contact their doctor and access their information in the same place.

We would also have loved to make this an educational application, in which people would learn how to best navigate our increasingly complex healthcare system and learn more about certain health practices (ie.vaccines) and their justification/background/history.

Despite these shortcomings, we believe we have the beginnings of the best health app the US has yet to see.
