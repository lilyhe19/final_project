Final Project for COSI 2A

This project was inspired by the intense debates on healthcare and how we can better take our health into our own hands. 
We also envisioned this as an educational application, in which people would be able to learn more about certain health practices,
(ie.vaccines) and their justification/background/history. 
The effective result of this project is actually a health application that can provide information and tips, 
calculate one's essential health statistics, help in sorting the logistics of taking care of one's health, 
as well as a place for people to discuss current issues in healthcare and medicine and medical research. 

Given more time, we would most definitely have worked on building charts and graphs for users, 
making personalized accounts through which patients could directly contact their doctor and access their information all in the same place, 
as well as more specific pointers on how to navigate our healthcare system as it becomes increasingly complex and difficult to maneuver. 

Despite these shortcomings, we believe we have the beginnings of the best health app the US has yet to see. 
Enjoy!
