Final Project for COSI 2A

This project was inspired by the intense debates on healthcare and how we can better take our health into our own hands.
We also envisioned this as an educational application, in which people would be able to learn more about certain health practices, (ie.vaccines) and their justification/background/history.
The effective result of this project is actually a health application that can provide information and tips,
calculate one's essential health statistics, help in sorting the logistics of taking care of one's health, as well as a place for people to discuss current issues in healthcare and medicine and medical research.

Given more time, we would most definitely have worked on building charts and graphs for users, making personalized accounts through which patients could directly contact their doctor and access their information all in the same place, as well as more specific pointers on how to navigate our healthcare system as it becomes increasingly complex and difficult to maneuver.

Despite these shortcomings, we believe we have the beginnings of the best health app the US has yet to see.

HERE **************************************
To ensure that you have a positive experience with this application, we'd like to provide an introduction on how to use it. The primary file in this entire package is called main.py. This file opens a home page for the application which includes more specific instructions, and allows you to access all the other functions within the package. Each function does something different; short descriptions are provided on the main.py homepage, and longer descriptions appear when you choose to use/run those functions.

Each function takes user input and generates relevant output. They can also be run multiple times and once you have used the function to your heart's content, you are given the option to return to the homepage, as long as you follow the instructions.
